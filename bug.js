While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to a missing or improperly configured dependency. The error message was quite generic, something along the lines of "Cannot find module 'react-native-screens'".  The project was set up with Expo managed workflow and should have had this dependency handled by Expo itself. I checked package.json and the dependency was listed. Installing it manually didn't solve the issue.  Additionally, `expo prebuild` was also failing.
